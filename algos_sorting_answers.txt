1. Write pseudocode for bubble sort.

	A:  

FUNCTION bubbleSort(collection)
   REPEAT
     SET swapped to false
     FOR i = FIRST INDEX of collection to LAST INDEX of collection - 1	
       IF collection[i] > collection[i + 1] THEN
         SET tmp to collection[i]
         SET collection[i] to collection[i + 1]
         SET collection[i + 1] to tmp
         SET swapped to true
       END IF
     END FOR
   UNTIL swapped is FALSE
   RETURN collection
 END FUNCTION

2. 

FUNCTION quickSort(collection)
   IF length of collection == 0
	return []
   IF length of collection == 1
	return collection[0]
   SET pivotPoint to ELEMENT at LAST INDEX of collection
   SET left = []
   SET right = []
   FOR i = FIRST INDEX of collection to LAST INDEX of collection - 1
	IF collection[i] < pivotPoint
		PUSH collection[i] into left[]
	ELSE IF collection[i] > pivotPoint
		PUSH collection[i] into right[]

   END FOR
   RETURN CONCATENATE quickSort(left) and pivotPoint and quickSort(right)
